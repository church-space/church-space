## How Billing Works

- **Upgrading** your plan:

  - You’ll be charged a **prorated amount** based on the time left in your current billing period.
  - At the start of your next billing cycle, you’ll be charged the **full amount** of the new plan.

- **Downgrading** your plan:
  - You’ll receive a **prorated credit** applied to your next invoice.
  - If you prefer a **refund** instead of a credit, contact **support@churchspace.co**.

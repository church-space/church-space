## Important Notes

- If **you connected your organization to Planning Center**, the connection will be deleted.  
  Someone else in your organization will need to reconnect it.

- If **you are the only owner** of your organization:
  - You will also be asked to **type in the organization name** to confirm.
  - Your organization will be **permanently deleted** along with your account.
  - **This cannot be undone.**

### Want to keep your organization?

Before deleting your account, make sure to assign **at least one other person** as an **owner** of the organization.  
That way, only your personal account is deleted, and the organization remains active.

If you need help adding someone else as an owner, [learn how here](/organization/manage-and-invite-members).

## Steps to Update Your Email

1. Click [Settings](https://churchspace.co/settings) on the sidebar.
2. Find the **Email** row in your profile settings.
3. Click your **current email address**.
4. In the dialog that appears, enter the **new email address** you’d like to use.
5. You’ll need to **confirm the change** from **both** your old and new email inboxes.
   - Check your inboxes and click **Confirm** on both emails.
   - Only after both confirmations will your email be officially updated.

## Why Two Confirmations?

For your security, we require confirmation from both email addresses. This prevents unauthorized changes and ensures you still have access to both accounts.

## Signed in with Google?

If you originally signed up using **Sign in with Google**, your email address is managed by Google and **cannot be changed** from Church Space.

If you need to update your login method or have special circumstances, contact us at **support@churchspace.co**.

Church Space offers two secure and simple ways to log in:

- **Sign in with Google**
- **Sign in with Email (Magic Link)**

---

## Sign in with Google

Signing in with your Google account is the fastest and most seamless option.

Just click the **“Sign in with Google”** button and follow the prompts.

---

## Sign in with Email

If you prefer not to use Google, you can sign in with your email. Church Space uses a **magic link** instead of a password.

### What to Expect

1. Enter your email address.
2. We’ll send you a login email with a link and a 6-digit code.
3. You can either:
   - Click the **button** in the email to open a login page and click **Continue**, or
   - Copy and paste the **code** into the login screen.

### Didn’t Get the Email?

Here are a few things to check:

- Look in your **spam** or **junk** folder.
- Make sure you entered the **correct email address**.
- If you’re not sure, you can **resend** the email from the login screen.
- Still stuck? Contact us at **support@churchspace.co**.

## Switching Between Login Methods

If you sign in with Google the first time and later sign in with Email using the **same email address**, your accounts will be **automatically linked**.

This means you can switch between login methods at any time without losing access to your account.

## Why We Don’t Use Passwords

Church Space uses **passwordless login** for your security and convenience.

- Magic links are **time-limited** and **single-use**, making them harder to exploit.
- No passwords means no password reuse or phishing risks.
- You stay secure without needing to remember or manage another login credential.

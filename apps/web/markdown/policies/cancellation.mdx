# Cancellation Policy

_Last updated: April 13, 2025_

<br />

We want satisfied customers, not hostages. That’s why we make it easy for you to cancel your account directly in our app — no phone calls required, no questions asked.

Account owners can follow [these instructions](https://help.churchspace.co/billing/cancelling-your-subscription) to cancel in-app: [https://churchspace.co/settings/billing](https://churchspace.co/settings/billing)

Our legal responsibility is to account owners, which means we cannot cancel an account at the request of anyone else. If for whatever reason you no longer know who the account owner is, [contact us](mailto:support@churchspace.co). We will gladly reach out to any current account owners at the email addresses we have on file.

## **What happens when you cancel an account?**

Upon cancellation, you can keep using your account until your pay period expires. Then the account will be downgraded to a free plan after the last date of the pay period in which you canceled. We recommend that you download everything you want to keep before canceling. You can also choose to delete your account earlier.

We won’t bill you again once you cancel. We don’t automatically prorate any unused time you may have left but if you haven’t used your account in months or just started a new billing cycle, [contact us](mailto:support@churchspace.co) for a [fair refund](https://churchspace.co/policies/refund). We’ll treat you right.

## **Church Space-initiated cancellations**

We may cancel accounts if they have been inactive for an extended period:

- For frozen accounts: 180 days after being frozen due to billing failures
- For free accounts: after 365 days of inactivity

We also retain the right to suspend or terminate accounts for any reason at any time, as outlined in our [Terms of Service](https://churchspace.co/policies/terms). In practice, this generally means we will cancel your account without notice if we have evidence that you are using our products to engage in [abusive behavior](https://churchspace.co/policies/use-restrictions).

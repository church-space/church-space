# Account Ownership Policy

_Last updated: April 13, 2025_

<br />

Accounts are owned by the organization detailed during signup, if this is a legal entity. If the organization is unincorporated, the account is owned by the individual who signed up for the account.

When you sign up and create a Church Space account, the person who originally signed up for the account is default designated the primary Account Owner or Manager, but the role can be reassigned. Again, unless the organization is not a legal entity, the account and data held it in, is ultimately owned by the organization.

### Account owners can:

- Access and export all data in an account.
- Manage all aspects of the account's subscription: including updating billing information; adding more users and account administrators; and canceling an account.
- Designate other account owners: Church Space accounts can have multiple owners. We recommend designating other owners you trust, so that updates can be made to the account when you're not available.

### What happens when none of the current account owners are available?

It happens — people switch jobs, get laid off, go on extended leave — the account owner(s) may be unavailable for any number of reasons. Still, our obligation is to the current account owner(s). That means we’re unable to add new owners to the account without permission from a current account owner, communicated from the email address we have on file.

If the account has been frozen due to non-payment for less than a week, we’ll be glad to thaw the account for a week or so, so people can access their work in the meantime.

The quickest route to add a new owner is often to contact a current account owner, and ask them to log in and add another owner right away in the account settings.

Otherwise, we can also gladly reach out to any current account owners at the email addresses we have on file, and request permission to add an owner. If it’s a company address and another employee has access to the inbox, the person who receives the email can grant permission to add a new owner. For security’s sake, permission must come from an address we have on file for a current account owner.

When none of the above is an option, a court order is required to add another owner to the account. We will of course readily comply with any court orders to turn data over to the appropriate party.

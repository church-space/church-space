        You will see the name &quot;Trivo Technologies LLC&quot; in a few places
        throughout these policies. This is our legal entity name. It was the
        working name for Church Space while the project was beginning. We say
        this to say, Trivo is the same people that build, own, and run Church
        Space. It is an honor for us to serve you and your churches.

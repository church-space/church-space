      Table with sheet. Sheet should have if it's public and the description.
      Part of onboarding after PCO should be selecting which list categories are
      public/let the user create list categories from Church Space that they
      want to use as public. I think it's a little complciated, but it keeps the
      management of lists in PCO so there's not extra steps for the user.
